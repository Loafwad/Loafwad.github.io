          Pirates the game that never was. Honestly, 
          Pirates was the most valuable learning experience I have ever had.
          It taught me so much about programming and 3D modeling that it was basically the foundation
          of all of my experience within 3D modeling and any advanced problem solving.
          Pirates was supposed to be a simple yet easy to expand on open world RPG game.
          The ideas we had planted in our head soon became too ambitious for us to even comprehend.
          The every growing complexity of this project became too big for our two little brains.
          </p>
          <p class="item__paragraph">
          Pirates was at first supposed to be a simple exploration game where you wander about,
          sail your ship from island to island and explore a very simplistic world yet exciting.
          Featuring treasure hunts, and easy to understand combat togheter with some simple sailing. 
          It later became too big. We wanted to add farming, fishing, merchants,
          and even though we fully realized that we couldn't. We still wanted to.
          We wanted to add realistic water physics and boat mechanics, even though we were so close
          to implementing everything we wanted our brains melted and there was too much of everything
          at once.
          </p>
          <p class="item__paragraph">
          Why Pirates failed to ever becoming a reality is clear. And I definitely took a lot of
          knowledge with me from this project. I hope to return to some of the mechanics in the near
          future like the realistic water and complex sailing mechanics I so desperately wanted to
          implement.
