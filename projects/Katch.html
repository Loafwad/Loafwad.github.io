            How Katch the demo became a reality was after sitting countless nights with my friend thinking about ideas for the perfect game.
            We realized a game doesn't have to be perfect it has to be fun.
            Ideas were hard to come by but we figured out a smart way of getting simple ideas and expanding on them rather than create something that makes sense.
            We asked one of the other students at our school to give us a random word and he said "Hugs".
          </p>
          <p class="item__paragraph">
            "Hugs" was the main theme the game was going to be based around. We never really managed to nail down the hugs in the game and it rather became a game of tag with a bunch of NPC's.
            Even though the game was terrible it was fun and entertaining even though the game had terrible controls when we considered it "finished"/"good enough" it was entertaining.
          </p>
          <p class="item__paragraph">
            With Katch being made in early October and our school soon going on a trip to SpillExpo 2018 Norway in Lillestr√∏m we actually got the oppertunity to set up a simple computer with the game running for people to try out.
            It became a hit! There were almost always someone playing the game and it was awesome. Someone even called it better than Fortnite however it was most likely ironic.
            It was an experience I am never going to forget.
