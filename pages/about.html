              My name is Nathaniel Brandal. I am a Game Developer currently located in Norway. 
              My passion is making games and to explore every creative corner of the universe. 
              I never say no to work for things I believe in and could never say no to the oppertunity to learn something new. 
            <br>
            <br>
              Ever since I got access to my first computer I was browsing the internet like crazy and exploring 
              every aspect of it. Then I wanted to understand it, learn how to make things for myself. 
              It took a few years before I had the oppertunity to start learning and expanding my knowledge. 
              But eventually I did and it was the best decision I have ever made, 
              I finally got to start turning my creative ideas in to a reality. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>My past:</b>
              What is important to know about me is my illness. As I am diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue which makes it very hard for me to retain my energy.
              Which has taught me how to portion my energy out over the day/week/month. Even though this is a negative thing, I still take great pride
              in being able to do the things I do and not letting my illness hinder me from doing what I want.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>My Education:</b>
            <br>
            <br>                  
            <b>Buskerud Folkehøgskole, Fiskum.</b> 
              What I learned most from spending a year at this school was teamwork and responsibility.
              We spent the year learning about game design and working togheter as a group.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>My Work Experience:</b>
            <br>
            <br>
              <b>Bygdeservice, Bjørkelangen.</b> Through this job I learned how to work effectively in a team 
                and being efficient at solving problems that occur at work.
